                Hey, I'm Phoenix. Initially, I started as an electrical engineer, but around a year ago, I became more interested
            in software engineering. What excites me about software engineering is how it allows you to create something unique
            and immediately distribute it around the world. I've always been a more creative person and want to translate that into code. During
            the process of making the game for my application to this course, I would ask my friends to play it and share their thoughts.
            I felt really satisfied when they told me they enjoyed the game and I found myself being motivated to find ways to make it even
            better so that they would enjoy it more. In the future I want to make more high quality applications so i can test myself and my
            coding ability and hopefully share the things I've made with the people around me. During this project I found myself running
            into so many problems but it never felt like a chore, I really enjoyed figuring out solutions whenever a bug popped up.
            
            </p>

            <p>
               I'll talk a bit about my experience with programming. I started my coding journey doing static programming with java
               in my first year of university, I learned about recursive calls, stack and heaps and how data is stored in memory. For my
               second year I learned C, which really helped me understand more about how programming worked on a fundamental level, this 
               involved things like pointers and error catching, I would also go on to use C to program embedded microcontrollers. After 
               my degree I worked as an electrical engineer so I didn't program but i still felt pulled towards it, in my spare time I
               would learn python, object orientated programming, data strutures and algorithms and even touch on some AWS courses.
               This is my first time really using javascript and I've really enjoyed the learning process, I hope to improve the 
               javascript knowledege that i've gained during these projects.
