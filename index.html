            <p>
                Hey, I'm Phoenix. Initially, I started as an electronic engineer, but around a year ago, I became more interested
            in software engineering. What excites me about software engineering is how it allows you to create something unique
            and distribute it around the world. I've always been a more creative person and want to translate that into code.
            Another ambition of mine is to experience the world and live in countries that I've always wanted to go to. Software
            engineering is truly a worldwide profession that allows people to do careers across the globe. I'm fully invested in becoming
            a software engineer and I'm enjoying learning something new everday.
            </p>

            <p>
               I started my coding journey doing static programming with java. However during my degree I learned C as that is what we
               would use to program embedded controllers. After learning C, i focused on learning python and did object orientated
               programming, data structures and algorithms and even AWS courses. This is my first time really using javascript and 
               I've really enjoyed the learning process.
